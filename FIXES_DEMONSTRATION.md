# Demonstration of Fixes

## Issue 1: Text Disappearing in Admin Input - FIXED ✓✓ (Enhanced)

### Problem
When an admin was typing a message in the chat interface, the text would disappear after a few seconds because the polling mechanism (which refreshes the chat every 5 seconds) would completely rewrite the HTML, including the textarea element. Even with save/restore logic, the cursor position and focus would be lost, interrupting the typing flow.

### Solution (Enhanced)
The `renderMessages()` function now:
1. **Checks if the textarea is currently focused (user is actively typing)**
2. **Skips the entire HTML update if the textarea is active** - preventing any interruption
3. Falls back to save/restore logic when textarea is not focused

### Code Changes (admin-script.js, line 134-206)
```javascript
renderMessages: function(messages) {
    const container = $('#aic-current-chat');
    
    // Check if input field is currently focused (user is typing)
    const inputIsFocused = $('#aic_admin_message_input').is(':focus');
    
    // If input is focused, skip the update to avoid interrupting user typing
    if (inputIsFocused) {
        console.log('Input field is focused, skipping HTML update to preserve user typing');
        return;
    }
    
    // Save current input value before rewriting HTML
    const currentInputValue = $('#aic_admin_message_input').val() || '';
    
    // ... HTML generation code ...
    
    container.html(html);
    
    // Restore the saved input value after HTML is rewritten
    if (currentInputValue) {
        $('#aic_admin_message_input').val(currentInputValue);
    }
    
    this.scrollToBottom();
}
```

### Impact
- **Zero interruption while typing** - textarea is not updated when in focus
- Cursor position and selection are perfectly preserved during active typing
- Messages are updated normally when user is not typing
- Admin can type messages seamlessly during auto-refresh
- No interference with the polling mechanism
- Perfect user experience with no jarring UI updates

## Issue 2: API Key Strings Being Translated - FIXED ✓

### Problem
The translation function would blindly send any text to the AI translation API, including messages that might contain API keys or other sensitive data. This is a security risk.

### Solution
Added validation to detect and skip translation of text containing API key patterns:

1. Added `contains_api_key()` method with regex patterns for common API key formats
2. Check text before translation and skip if API key pattern detected
3. Log warning when API key is detected

### Code Changes (ai-multilingual-chat.php, line 707-761)
```php
private function translate_message($text, $from_lang, $to_lang) {
    // Skip translation if text contains API key patterns
    if ($this->contains_api_key($text)) {
        $this->log('Пропуск перевода: обнаружен API ключ в тексте', 'warning');
        return null;
    }
    // ... rest of translation logic ...
}

private function contains_api_key($text) {
    // Patterns for common API key formats
    $api_key_patterns = array(
        '/sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{32,}/',           // OpenAI keys (sk-...)
        '/aic_[a-zA-Z0-9]{20,}/',          // Plugin mobile API keys (aic_...)
        '/AIzaSy[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{33}/',       // Google API keys
        '/[a-zA-Z0-9]{32,64}/',            // Generic long alphanumeric strings
        '/Bearer\s+[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+/i',     // Bearer tokens
        '/api[_-]?key[:\s=]+[a-zA-Z0-9]+/i', // Explicit API key mentions
    );
    
    foreach ($api_key_patterns as $pattern) {
        if (preg_match($pattern, $text)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

### Detected Patterns
The function detects and blocks translation of:
- **OpenAI API Keys**: `sk-1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
- **Plugin Mobile Keys**: `aic_abcdefghij1234567890xyz`
- **Google API Keys**: `AIzaSyAbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz1234567`
- **Bearer Tokens**: `Bearer sk-1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
- **Explicit Mentions**: `api_key: XXX` or `api-key=XXX`
- **Long Alphanumeric**: Any 32-64 character alphanumeric string

### Impact
- Prevents accidental exposure of API keys to translation services
- Protects sensitive data from being logged or transmitted
- Normal user messages are not affected

## Testing

### Test Suite Created

#### 1. Input Preservation Tests (`tests/test-input-preservation.js`)
Tests the original save/restore functionality:
- ✓ Old version without fix: Text is lost during HTML replacement
- ✓ New version with fix: Text is preserved during HTML replacement

**Test Results**: ✓ All tests passed!

#### 2. Focus Preservation Tests (`tests/test-focus-preservation.js`)
Tests the enhanced focus-aware functionality:

**Test Cases (3 scenarios)**: ✓ All Passed
- **Test 1**: Input NOT focused - normal update with text preservation
- **Test 2**: Input IS focused - update skipped, focus and value preserved
- **Test 3**: After user finishes typing - update performed on next poll

**Test Results**: ✓ All tests passed!
```
Test 1 (Not focused - normal update): ✓ PASS
Test 2 (Focused - skip update): ✓ PASS  
Test 3 (After blur - allow update): ✓ PASS
```

This ensures that:
- When user is actively typing (field is focused), no UI updates interrupt them
- When user is not typing, messages are updated normally
- Text is preserved in both scenarios

#### 3. API Key Filtering Tests (`tests/test-api-key-filtering.php`)
A comprehensive test suite with 13 test cases:

**API Key Detection Tests (7 cases)**: ✓ All Passed
- OpenAI API key format
- Plugin mobile API key format
- Google API key format
- Bearer token with key
- Explicit API key mention
- API key assignment syntax
- Long alphanumeric strings

**Normal Text Tests (6 cases)**: ✓ All Passed
- Normal greeting messages
- Regular chat messages
- Short password-like strings
- Email addresses
- API endpoint URLs
- Text mentioning "API" (but not containing keys)

### Test Results
```
Input Preservation Tests: ✓ All tests passed!
Focus Preservation Tests: ✓ All tests passed!
API Key Filtering Tests: 13 tests, 13 passed, 0 failed
Success Rate: 100%
✓ All tests passed!
```

## Summary

Both critical issues have been successfully resolved:

1. ✓ **Text no longer disappears** from the admin input field during auto-refresh
2. ✓ **API keys are now filtered** and prevented from being sent to translation APIs

The changes are minimal, focused, and thoroughly tested. No breaking changes were introduced.
