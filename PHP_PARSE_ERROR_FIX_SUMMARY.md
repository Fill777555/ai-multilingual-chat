# PHP Parse Error Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue Description
Fix the PHP parse error "Unclosed '{'" in the file `ai-multilingual-chat.php`. The error was reported on line 357, possibly related to line 16.

## Investigation Findings

After thorough investigation using multiple analysis methods:

1. **PHP Syntax Check (`php -l`)**: No syntax errors detected
2. **PHP Tokenizer Analysis**: All braces are properly balanced
3. **WordPress Environment Simulation**: File loads successfully
4. **Character Encoding Check**: Proper UTF-8 encoding, no hidden characters

### Conclusion
The actual file had no PHP parse errors. However, formatting issues were identified:
- Excessive blank lines (3 consecutive) between code blocks at line 1616

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Cleanup (`ai-multilingual-chat.php`)
**Location**: Lines 1615-1620
**Change**: Removed 2 excessive blank lines

```diff
     });
 });
 
-
-
 add_action('admin_menu', function() {
```

This minimal change improves code formatting consistency and follows WordPress coding standards.

### 2. Test Suite (`tests/test-php-parse-error-fix.php`)
Created a comprehensive test file that verifies:
- ✓ PHP syntax correctness
- ✓ Brace balance using PHP tokenizer
- ✓ No excessive blank lines (max 2 consecutive)
- ✓ Proper formatting of lines 16, 357, and 1616
- ✓ WordPress environment compatibility
